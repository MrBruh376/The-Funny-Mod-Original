# The-Funny-Mod-Original

hello yes, this is the README for The Funny Mod, made for minecraft 1.17.1, created by ElRasho21 on curseforge and 'el rasho#9177' on discord üëç

DM me on discord if you need source files, i'll (usually) be glad to help

What you can do (if you are very cool and awesome): Make your own addons to the funny mod, use the funny mod in minecraft for both single player and multi player, distribute the funny mod, look at the funny mod and look at the source code, ask for new things to add to addons for the funny mod (or make addons yourself)

What you can't do (do these if you aren't cool or awesome): Sell the funny mod, sell edits of the funny mod, make private addons for the funny mod (they have to be open source and NOT paid to use), violate the license.
